"Everything I know is from Jenny Bryan"â€”Sharla Gelfand

- as spoken at [rstudio:conf 2020](https://sharla.party/talk/2020-01-01-rstudio-conf/)


Which then prompted this twitter exchange:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What about a hexagon enclosing &quot;EIKIFJB&quot; over a laptop aflame.</p>&mdash; Miles McBain (@MilesMcBain) <a href="https://twitter.com/MilesMcBain/status/1224441486369910786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<P>

The burning laptop is a reference to Jenny Bryan's [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) (2017-12-12).

The Rmd file EIKIFJB.Rmd uses the [{hexSticker}](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker) package to generate a laptop on fire EIKIFJB sticker.

Roger Peng: Jenny's talk was great too. She has an incredible ability to just kind of see that higher level of stuff after having been in the trenches for so long.

Hilary Parker: Exactly. Going into the detail and understanding the nitty-gritty but then being able to zoom out and create the paradigm for it. It's not easy.
