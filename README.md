"Everything I know is from Jenny Bryan"—Sharla Gelfand

- as spoken at [rstudio:conf 2020](https://sharla.party/talk/2020-01-01-rstudio-conf/)

At the rstudio::conf 2020, Sharla Gelfand [@sharlagelfand] gave a presentation with the title ["Don’t repeat yourself, talk to yourself! Repeated reporting in the R universe"](https://sharla.party/talk/2020-01-01-rstudio-conf/), "showcasing opportunities to stop repeating yourself and instead anticipate the needs of and communicate effectively with your future self (or the next person with your job!) using project-oriented workflows, clever interactivity, templated analyses, functions, and yes, your own packages." ([Video is here.](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2020/dont-repeat-yourself-talk-to-yourself-repeated-reporting-in-the-r-universe-sharla-gelfand
))

In the Q&A section (at 18' 22" of the video), someone in the audience asked "A lot of your recommendations seem to be software engineering principles. Would you recommend R users have formal education in this field to prevent troubles?" 

Sharla responded with "No, I have no training in software engineering at all. **Everything I know is from Jenny Bryan.** So I think you're all fine."

The burning laptop is a reference to Jenny Bryan's [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) (2017-12-12).
